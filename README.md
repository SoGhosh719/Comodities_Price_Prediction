## Hybrid Forecasting Framework for Commodity Price Trends

### Description:

This project presents a robust framework for forecasting commodity price trends by combining traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning techniques. It focuses on five key commodities—Gold, Silver, Copper, Palladium, and Platinum—spanning data from 2000 to 2024. The framework integrates ARIMA models for capturing linear time-series dependencies and Random Forest algorithms to address non-linear patterns, significantly improving predictive accuracy.

### Key Features and Contributions:
Hybrid Modeling Approach:

- Implemented ARIMA for time-series analysis, capturing trends, seasonality, and autocorrelations in price data.
- Utilized Random Forest to model complex non-linear relationships and interactions among features like volume, moving averages, and daily percentage changes.
- Developed a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both models, offering enhanced robustness for volatile commodities like Palladium and Silver.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Conducted thorough EDA to uncover long-term trends, correlations, and volatility patterns in commodity prices.
- Visualized market dynamics using correlation heatmaps, time-series plots, and bar charts for feature importance.
- Identified Gold and Silver as highly correlated, while Palladium emerged as the most volatile commodity.

### Feature Engineering:

- Engineered predictive features such as rolling averages, lagged prices, and daily percentage changes to improve model performance.
- Assessed the importance of features like trading volume and moving averages for price prediction using Random Forest.

### Accuracy Metrics:

- Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE to quantify predictive accuracy.
- The hybrid model consistently outperformed standalone ARIMA and Random Forest models, particularly for volatile markets.

### Use Cases:

- Provides actionable insights for investors and industry stakeholders to optimize portfolio diversification, risk management, and procurement strategies.
- Supports decision-making in commodities trading and financial planning by leveraging predictive analytics.

### Tools and Technologies:
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- Algorithms: ARIMA, Random Forest, Hybrid Models
- Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn for trends, correlations, and feature importance.

### Future Work:
- Incorporate external macroeconomic factors (e.g., inflation, geopolitical events) to improve model accuracy.
- Expand the scope to include additional commodities like oil, natural gas, and agricultural products.
- Explore advanced machine learning models like LSTM or Transformer networks for real-time forecasting.
- Develop interactive dashboards for real-time predictions and visualizations.

### Project Impact:

This project bridges the gap between traditional econometric methods and modern machine learning, offering a practical solution for understanding and forecasting commodity markets' complexities. It is particularly relevant for stakeholders in finance, manufacturing, and trade.
